 A blockchain is a distributed decentralized digital ledger that holds information and can be used to maintain transparency in a system and the integrity of the data in that system.

 A 'Blockchain', as it sounds, is a chain of blocks (a small file that holds some data and can not be altered or tampered with) cryptographically linked together and replicated among a large network of people with no-one having control.
